review/text: This being one of my favorite game soundtracks ever, I've listened to it probably a thousand times. Especially for people who played the game it's very interesting, but also for people who are into great ambient and classical themes this might be just the perfect creation. This album is in great contrast with it's predecessor, at least in my opinion. This album is way beyond, like Yasunori Mitsuda has truly evolved. What can I say? He's a mastermind, that's for sure. I'm not gonna name my personal favorites, because...well...that's something you should decide for yourself. So...get this! And decide! By the way, the tracklisting is in japanese but you can find an English translation on the internet.
