review/summary: Nice collection of Julie Strain images
review/text: This is only for Julie Strain fans. It's a collection of her photos -- about 80 pages worth with a nice section of paintings by Olivia.If you're looking for heavy literary content, this isn't the place to find it -- there's only about 2 pages with text and everything else is photos.Bottom line: if you only want one book, the Six Foot One ... is probably a better choice, however, if you like Julie like I like Julie, you won't go wrong on this one either.
